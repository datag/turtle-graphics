## Examples

Have a look at [src/examples](./src/examples).

## Manual control

### Buttons

Click the control buttons to move forward/backward, turn left/right 45¬∞/90¬∞, move the pen up/down, change the pen color and width, and undo the last operation.

### Keyboard

| Key          | Function            |
| ------------ | ------------------- |
| Cursor up    | Forward             |
| Cursor down  | Backward            |
| Cursor left  | Turn left 45¬∞       |
| Cursor right | Turn right 45¬∞      |
| Space        | Pen down            |
| Escape       | Pen up              |
| Backspace    | Undo last operation |
